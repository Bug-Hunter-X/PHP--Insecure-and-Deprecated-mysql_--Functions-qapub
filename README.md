This repository demonstrates a common, yet critical, error in PHP code: the use of deprecated `mysql_*` functions.  These functions are highly vulnerable to SQL injection and are no longer supported in modern PHP versions. The `bug.php` file showcases insecure code using deprecated functions. The `bugSolution.php` file offers a secure alternative using parameterized queries with PDO or MySQLi.
